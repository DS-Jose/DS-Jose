### Hi there 👋

I'm José, a motivated data analytics professional with a passion for gaining insights from data.

🔭 I'm currently working on expanding my skills in SQL, Tableau, and Python to take my data analysis abilities to the next level.

🌱 I'm currently learning machine learning techniques and how to leverage statistical models to optimize business outcomes.

🤔 I'm looking for opportunities to apply my analytical toolset of Excel, databases, and BI tools to solve challenging business problems through data.

📫 Reach out to me on [LinkedIn]([https://www.linkedin.com/in/your-linkedin-username/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joservelazquez/) to discuss anything data!

⚡ Fun fact: When I'm not crunching data, you can find me outdoors hiking!
