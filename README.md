### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm JosÃ©, a motivated data analytics professional with a passion for gaining insights from data.

ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on expanding my skills in SQL, Tableau, and Python to take my data analysis abilities to the next level.

ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning machine learning techniques and how to leverage statistical models to optimize business outcomes.

ðŸ¤” I'm looking for opportunities to apply my analytical toolset of Excel, databases, and BI tools to solve challenging business problems through data.

ðŸ“« Reach me through LinkedIn or email to discuss a project!

âš¡ Fun fact: When I'm not crunching data, you can find me outdoors hiking!
